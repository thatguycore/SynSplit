This is a very simple script/program that will take your Synergism save file and split it into three portions that you can import into the calculator.

Usage is very simple. Either download the synsplit.py or synsplit.exe if you don't want to setup python and then put it in its own directory. Then take your Synergism save file and drop it into the same directory as the program.
If you have multiple save files the script will ask which one you would like to use. After selecting the save file it will split it into 3 other txt files. Box_1.txt, Box_2.txt, Box_3.txt.
